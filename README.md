This is a repository named OpTool to optimize the images.

Till now everyone apply, the optimization at image level, but here we have planned to build a tool which work 
as a daemon process as your image starts building. Basically, other things removing redundancy, dead code, 
other irrelevant contains will be removed. So, your memory use is efficient.
